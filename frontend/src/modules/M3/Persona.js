            <span><h1>Definition:</h1> a persona is the ideal target user of a product, service, or solution. Personas are developed through research, observation, and analysis of real users and their behaviours, needs, motivations, and pain points. Personas are used as a tool to develop a deeper understanding of the target audience and to guide the design, development, and marketing of a product or service. By creating a persona, you can ensure that your solution is tailored to the specific needs of your target users, leading to higher user adoption, satisfaction, and success.</span>
