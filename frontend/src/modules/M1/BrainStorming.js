            <h1>Brain Storming vs MindMapping</h1>
            <span>Brainstorming is a technique for generating ideas, while mind mapping is a tool for organizing and connecting ideas. Brainstorming is typically done in a group setting, while mind mapping is usually done individually. Both techniques can be useful for generating and organizing ideas, and they can be used together as part of a larger creative process.</span>
