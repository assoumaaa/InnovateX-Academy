            <span><h1>Working or coded prototyping: </h1>To test your product's functionality in a development environment, you may choose to create a coded prototype. This form of prototype only functions to a limited extent, unlike a visible prototype. It might not have all the features you had in mind, but you can get a general idea of if the issue is resolved. This provides a more tangible example of how your design appears, feels, and performs, but it was created with illogical, not scaleable code.</span>
            <span><h1>Technical or functional prototyping: </h1>Testing a given code solution's viability by creating a mockup of a product's back end, such as determining whether two data systems can communicate with one another, putting an ordering system to the test, or honing AI to match words or data points. This is intended to be an engineering test to make sure you can implement your proposal.</span>
