            <span><h1>Physical prototyping: </h1>Creating a mock-up of your product to understand dimensions, buttons, features, or design so you can see what it looks like in real life.  This could be a hastily created 3D model, a simplified version of the model, or a single supplier sample. Although it is typically not useful, you can get an idea of the size, materials, and appearance.</span>
            <span><h1>Design (UX/UI) or visual prototyping: </h1>On a software level, outlining usability, or how a person navigates through the software step by step, within a dashboard, website, or marketing campaign in order to gather input from users and team members on logic, intended functionality, and overall design. This frequently takes the shape of a sketch, either on paper or within a software program like PowerPoint. Although none of the features can be used, the prototype shows how they would function in various situations and how they would appear.</span>
